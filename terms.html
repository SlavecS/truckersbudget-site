            <h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>
            <p>By downloading, installing, or using Trucker's Budget ("the app"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

            <h2>Description of Service</h2>
            <p>Trucker's Budget is a personal finance and mileage tracking tool designed for truck drivers, including owner-operators (1099) and company drivers (W-2). The app allows you to track income, expenses, trips, vehicle maintenance, and generate reports. The app is intended as a personal record-keeping tool and does not provide financial, tax, or legal advice.</p>

            <h2>Account Registration</h2>
            <p>To use the app, you must create an account using an email address and password, Sign in with Apple, or Google Sign-In. You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure and for all activity that occurs under your account. You must notify us immediately if you believe your account has been compromised.</p>

            <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p>You agree to use the app only for its intended purpose of personal trucking finance and mileage tracking. You agree not to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the app, other users' accounts, or our systems</li>
                <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the app</li>
                <li>Use the app for any illegal purpose</li>
                <li>Interfere with or disrupt the app's functionality</li>
                <li>Misrepresent your identity or impersonate another person</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>The Trucker's Budget app, including its design, code, graphics, logos, interface, and all related content, is owned by its developer and protected by applicable intellectual property laws. "Trucker's Budget" is our trademark. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the app or its content without our prior written consent. Nothing in these Terms grants you any right to use our trademarks, branding, or logos.</p>

            <h2>Your Data and Content</h2>
            <p>You own the data you enter into the app. We do not claim ownership of your financial records, trip data, receipts, or any other content you create. Our use of your data is governed by our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
            <p>By using the app, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive license to process, store, and transmit your data solely as necessary to provide, maintain, and improve the app's functionality (such as syncing data across your devices, generating reports, and providing cloud backup). This license exists only for the purpose of operating the service and ends when you delete your account.</p>
            <p>You are responsible for maintaining your own backups of important financial records. While we provide cloud sync through iCloud and Firestore, we recommend keeping independent copies of critical documents for tax and business purposes.</p>

            <h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>
            <p>The app provides tools for tracking and calculating income, expenses, mileage, and generating reports. These calculations are based on the data you enter. We do not guarantee the accuracy of any calculations for tax filing, legal compliance, or regulatory purposes. You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of your records and should consult a qualified tax professional or accountant for tax-related decisions.</p>

            <h2>Availability and Updates</h2>
            <p>We strive to keep the app available and functional, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted access. The app may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, updates, or circumstances beyond our control. We may update the app from time to time, which may add, change, or remove features.</p>

            <h2>Subscriptions and Pricing</h2>
            <p>Trucker's Budget may offer both free and paid features. Some functionality may require an active subscription to access. Subscription pricing, duration, and included features will be clearly displayed within the app before any purchase.</p>
            <p>Subscriptions are billed through Apple's App Store and are subject to Apple's terms and policies. You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple ID settings (Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions). Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period — you will retain access to paid features until then.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to change subscription pricing. Any price changes will apply only to new or renewing subscriptions and will not affect your current billing period. We will not charge you without your explicit consent.</p>

            <h2>Refunds</h2>
            <p>All purchases and subscriptions are processed by Apple through the App Store. Refund requests must be submitted directly to Apple in accordance with their refund policies. We do not process payments or issue refunds directly. For instructions on requesting a refund, visit <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084">Apple's support page</a>.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The app integrates with third-party services including Firebase (Google) and Apple iCloud for authentication, data storage, and syncing. These services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or practices of third-party services. For details on how these services handle your data, please refer to our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

            <h2>Termination</h2>
            <p>You may delete your account at any time through the app's settings (Settings → Delete Account). This will remove your authentication data, cloud-stored profile, and associated records.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms, though we will make reasonable efforts to notify you before doing so.</p>

            <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>The app is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the app will be error-free, secure, or available at all times.</p>
            <p>Trucker's Budget is not a tax preparation service, accounting firm, or financial advisor. Nothing in the app constitutes professional financial or legal advice.</p>

            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Trucker's Budget and its developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, or business interruption, arising from your use of the app.</p>

            <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes by posting the updated terms within the app or on our website. Your continued use of the app after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

            <h2>Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, United States, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
